       Last year due to covid I was doing virtual learning. I am in the drama club, I love theatre. Acting and singing are two of my favorite things to do. I love a lot of broadway shows and I would love to go see Dear Evan Hansen one day! My favorite subjects in school are math, web design and history! Over the summer I did a 20 hour roadtrip to Orlando Florida! That trip was one of my favorite trips I have ever been on and I had an amazing time being there with my family. We went to Disney World, Animal Kingdom and Epcot. It was my first time going to Disney since I was about one year old!</h4></div>

           I love a lot of horror,comedy and marvel movies. One of my favorite movie series would be Harry Potter, I want to go to Universal World in Florida this summer to go to Harry Potter world. Some of my favorite shows is New Girl, The Office, Friends, The Vampire Diaries and Black Mirror. The worst part about liking these shows is most of them are taken off netflix!

             I really liked the FTHS bootstrap project! I feel there was more code to use to make my site look more appealing and it helped me improve my skills. I also love the Halloween site we made in October that was fun to make!
